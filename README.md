## Introduction

As part of our requirements to graduate from the skill harvest Data analysis programme we have been asked to collect data from any agricultural set and to carefully analyse the data while creating dashboards and interractive visuals. Our dataset was extracted from Kaggle [^1]. It is a detailed analysis of agricultural produce sales, supply and pricing. 
## Executive Summary
---
This dataset provides comprehensive information on agricultural product sales, supply chain metrics, and pricing across various categories, including Vegetables, Fruits, Grains, Dairy, and Livestock, for the years 2022 and 2023. It contains detailed records for over 8,000 transactions, capturing essential data points such as product IDs, product names, categories, price per kilogram, units shipped, units sold, units on hand, supplier information, farm locations, and sale dates.
## Objectives

We will include in our project deliverables such as charts, graphs, tables, cards, gauge, question and answers, matrices and tables.
