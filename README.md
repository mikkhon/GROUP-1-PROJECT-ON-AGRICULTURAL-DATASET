## Project Title
---
A PROJECT ON ANALYSING DATA OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE SALES, SUPPLY AND PRICING 
## Project Team members
---
*Mike Imianvan

*Bernadine Nnaji

*Adenowo Titobiloluwa Kehinde

## Project Date
---
Prepared in November 2024

## Introduction
---
As part of our requirements to graduate from the skill harvest Data analysis programme we have been asked to collect data from any agricultural set and to carefully analyse the data while creating dashboards and interractive visuals. Our dataset was extracted from Kaggle[^1]. It is a detailed analysis of agricultural produce sales, supply and pricing. 

## Executive Summary
---
This dataset provides comprehensive information on agricultural product sales, supply chain metrics, and pricing across various categories, including Vegetables, Fruits, Grains, Dairy, and Livestock, for the years 2022 and 2023. It contains detailed records for over 8,000 transactions, capturing essential data points such as product IDs, product names, categories, price per kilogram, units shipped, units sold, units on hand, supplier information, farm locations, and sale dates.

## Objectives
---
The main objective of this roject is to ensure that we are able to clean up the original dataset, transform it and subsequently load it into a Power Query GUI.Thereafter we use our skills of data visualisation to present a report of which we can malke insights and cleverly tell a strory around our data. 

##  Scope
---
We will include in our project deliverables such as charts, graphs, tables, cards, gauge, question and answers, matrices and tables. 

## Data Sources
---
Our raw data set was extracted from Kaggle as located in **kaggle.com** <sup>1</sup> and authoured by KDS Toys. 
## Tools Used
---
The tools we used include:

  *Microsoft Excel [Download]{http://www.Microsoft.com}

  *Microsoft PowerBi [Download]{http://www.Microsoft.com}
  
  *Kaggle [Download] http://www.Kaggle.com

  ## DAX EXPRESSIONS
  ---
  We inserted into the table a new measure called Return on Investment (ROI)
  We also included a calculated column called category groups. The essence is to carefully group the cateories such that it becomes easier to interprete.
  
  ## Data Visualisation
  ---
  The visuals were created using a PowerBi report GUI. A copy of both the powerBi and the Screenshot is as attached. 
  Our Visuals ranged from tables, cards, Gauges, Line graph, piecharts, Barcharts

 ## Data Insights
 ---
This project highlights the importance of understanding sales dynamics, supplier contributions, and category performance in the agricultural industry. The insights provide a foundation for making informed decisions to optimize operations, manage suppliers effectively, and drive revenue growth. This project has the total number of Twenty suppliers, sum of 227 million(kg) units of products shipped under the period of review. 
The highest unit sold was the beef while carrot is the lowest units sold. The highest supplier of agricultural product is Dairyland Coop with 6279906 while the lowest supplier is Nature's Best Produce with 5124041 quantity.
We fixed our return on investment on units sold multiplied by price per unit for each produce. Hence the return on Investment for the year was 413.58million. This was a good yield regardless, though we would have to compare with YOY (year on Year) results to ascertain any appreciable increase

The total product names is 28. The price of the produce was highest in October. That can also mean that few people may be able to afford them towards the end of the year because of the high price.
